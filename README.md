| Simple Checkout View   | A clean page where users finish booking and see confirmation               |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

If a booking website is easy to use, more people will use it. It helps users:

- Trust the platform
- Quickly find and book what they need
- Stay on the site without getting frustrated
- Come back again or tell others about it

Good design makes the site work better on all devices, loads faster, and makes the whole experience enjoyable.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Looking at the colors, fonts, and spacing in a Figma mockup helps everyone on the team understand what the final website should look like.

Why it matters:

- Keeps everything looking the same
- Helps developers build things correctly
- Makes the site easier to use for everyone
- Speeds up teamwork and makes feedback faster

## Pages

| Page              | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing  | Grid of available properties with search and filters         |
| Property Detail   | Full details with gallery, price, host info, and booking     |
| Checkout          | Simple and secure booking form with confirmation step        |

## Component Patterns

- **Navbar**: Has the logo, search bar, user menu, and works well on all screen sizes
- **Property Card**: Shows an image, price, location, and lets users favorite listings
- **Footer**: Contains links, company info, and social media

All components are made to be reused and work the same across all pages.
