### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system to reduce friction during the user's journey and to increase the likelihood of conversion. When users can easily find listings, understand the offerings, and complete their bookings without confusion or frustration, it directly leads to:

- Higher trust and credibility
- Increased booking completions
- Lower bounce and drop-off rates
- Improved overall user satisfaction

By focusing on clear navigation, fast interactions, accessible interfaces, and clean layouts, the application ensures a pleasant experience that encourages users to return and recommend the platform.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Understanding and identifying the design properties in a Figma mockup ensures smooth communication between designers and developers. It allows for accurate implementation of UI elements and helps build a scalable, consistent user interface.

Benefits include:

- **Consistency**: Uniform use of colors, fonts, and spacing throughout the app.
- **Developer Clarity**: Developers can easily translate designs into code with precise specs.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Proper font sizes and contrast ratios improve usability.
- **Scalable Design System**: Encourages reusable components and modular design.
- **Faster Handoff**: Reduces ambiguity and shortens feedback loops during development.
