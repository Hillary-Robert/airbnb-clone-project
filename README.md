### Importance of User-Friendly Design

If a booking website is easy to use, more people will use it. It helps users:

- Trust the platform
- Quickly find and book what they need
- Stay on the site without getting frustrated
- Come back again or tell others about it

Good design makes the site work better on all devices, loads faster, and makes the whole experience enjoyable.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Looking at the colors, fonts, and spacing in a Figma mockup helps everyone on the team understand what the final website should look like.

Why it matters:

- **Consistency**: Everything looks the same everywhere
- **Developer Clarity**: Developers know exactly what to build
- **Accessibility**: Proper fonts and colors help all users
- **Reusable Design**: Easier to use components in more places
- **Faster Handoff**: Speeds up teamwork and testing

## Pages

| Page              | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing  | Grid of available properties with search and filters         |
| Property Detail   | Full details with gallery, price, host info, and booking     |
| Checkout          | Simple and secure booking form with confirmation step        |

## UI Component Patterns

In this project, we will build and reuse different parts of the user interface called components. These components help keep the design clean and make the code easier to manage.

### Navbar

- This will be at the top of every page.
- It will include the **logo**, **search bar**, and **user navigation** (like login, profile, or bookings).
- The navbar will change size or layout depending on the screen size (responsive).

### Property Card

- These cards will show each property on the listing page.
- Each card will include a **property image**, **title**, **location**, **price per night**, and **rating**.
- It may also include a **heart icon** to let users save their favorites.
- These cards will adjust automatically to fit different screen sizes.

### Footer

- This will be at the bottom of every page.
- It will include **useful links**, **about the company**, and **social media icons**.
- It gives users quick access to important pages and information.

Each component will be made in a way that it can be reused across the website. This helps us keep the design consistent and makes updates easier later on.
